HI,

This is the readme file, created by ACHKAR Amine just for testing the "inovator" repository. I suggest you if you are in linux machine to start by install git.  If you work in Ubuntu you just have to type this commande in the commande line : "apt-get install git-all" you shoud execute it like root.

So tks for reading ;)
